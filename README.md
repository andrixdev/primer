# Discussion
* underscore_case to kebabCase in sfx variables?
* Music: I kinda like the placeholder one! It gives some energy and calls for action. Maybe for this abstract and repetitive game I'd go for minimalism with only a few notes. I checked http://listen.hatnote.com/#en and started reading briefly on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_ancient_Greece wondering what music Euclid might have listened! More thinking to come...
